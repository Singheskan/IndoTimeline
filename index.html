                <h2>Arrival</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The flight was long, really long, 24 hours from Frankfurt to Jakarta with an eight hour stop in Doha.
                    I had a lot of time checking out the airport which was easily explorable through a futuristic, mostly glass-made railway driving above the heads
                    of mere citizens which were eager to find their gates by foot. After arriving in Jakarta and passing the border control I was greeted by students
                    of the Universitas Indonesia (UI) dressed in bright, yellow suit jackets (looking as bad as it sounds).
                    Hasbi was one of them which accompanied me and William, another student from Darmstadt, to our apartments at the Margonda Residence in Depok.
                    As we were on the road around 5pm we were not the only ones trying to get their way to Jakarta. The traffic was unbelievable
                    and scooter drivers insane in their confidence to maneuver through this see of vehicles. It was intense but we made it out alive as it seems to be
                    a general practice of Indonesians to drive in such circumstances. My buddy Desti welcomed me at the residence and showed me my apartment
                    in the allegedly 16th floor of the building. (The elevator misses out floor 14 and 15 as they’re not selectable) Afterwards,
                    I could catch a good night of sleep, even though an Islamic priest woke me up at 4 in the morning. It was a good day.</p> <!-- Section Content -->
