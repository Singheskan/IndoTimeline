                <h2>Arrival</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The flight was long, really long, 24 hours from Frankfurt to Jakarta
                    with an eight hour stop in Doha.
                    I had a lot of time checking out the airport which was easily explorable through a futuristic,
                    mostly glass-made railway driving above the heads
                    of mere citizens which were eager to find their gates by foot. After arriving in Jakarta and passing
                    the border control I was greeted by students
                    of the Universitas Indonesia (UI) dressed in bright, yellow suit jackets (looking as bad as it
                    sounds).
                    Hasbi was one of them which accompanied me and William, another student from Darmstadt, to our
                    apartments at the Margonda Residence in Depok.
                    As we were on the road around 5pm we were not the only ones trying to get their way to Jakarta. The
                    traffic was unbelievable
                    and scooter drivers insane in their confidence to maneuver through this see of vehicles. It was
                    intense but we made it out alive as it seems to be
                    a general practice of Indonesians to drive in such circumstances. My buddy Desti welcomed me at the
                    residence and showed me my apartment
                    in the allegedly 16th floor of the building. (The elevator misses out floor 14 and 15 as they’re not
                    selectable) Afterwards,
                    I could catch a good night of sleep, even though an Islamic priest woke me up at 4 in the morning.
                    It was a good day.</p> <!-- Section Content -->

                <h2>Orientation</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">It is crazy how living in a completely different country can become
                    simple routine in just a week. The crowded shattering of a docent vehicles fades to white noise
                    while I manage to find my way through Depok (city on the southern border of Jakarta) by myself. My
                    co-students and I underwent several events in the last days, including orientation days to get to
                    know the campus and the library (which is apparently the biggest in south-east Asia), as well as
                    team building events to get to know each other. Surprisingly, everyone seems to get along
                    independent of cultural, religious, or national differences. The Indonesian people are so proactive
                    and helpful that anxieties of any kind are never present. Another student was capturing this feeling
                    very good by saying that: “I am so cherished and cared for that I do not feel as I have left home.”
                    One of the events was the Orientation Day in which we were introduced into some organizational
                    topics as well as cultural aspects of Indonesia, including a local dance performed bare foot with a
                    plate in each hand. Those plates were circularly moved while dancing and sometimes even moved on
                    without breaking. I have never seen something that exotic before.
                    In the last days I had also enough time to organize my apartment, buy a second hand guitar in
                    Jakarta and spend a whole day in Jakarta’s tourist districts. As it seems, we tourists are part of
                    the attractions as well, especially the Caucasian looking exchange students, as several inhabitants
                    asked them frequently to take pictures with them. Even I was asked twice!
                    Today I had the chance to meet Dr. Ade Azurat a member of the faculty of computer science at UI who
                    gave me a tour through the campus and even introduced me to everyone I might contact in the future,
                    including the head of Master students, secretariat, and faculty speaker. He is a very nice guy with
                    a great taste of humor. I am planning to take a Bioinformatics and Advanced Computer Vision class.
                    As I am working as a freelancer for Fraunhofer I will probably not find the time to take more
                    courses. (Besides seeing the country of course)

                <h2>Culture & Nature</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The area around Jakarta is filled with various mysterious places and
                    stores in which you can easily loose yourself. One of them was a miniature park representing
                    different areas of Indonesia, including Bali, Sumatra, and Borneo. The UI Buddy Club organized a
                    tour for us in which we were introduced to the cultural differences between the different parts of
                    Indonesia. Those differences were shown in examples of ceremonial dresses, tools & weaponry, as well
                    as construction and art. Even though the regions uniformed as one country they are still remarkably
                    unique and differentiable from each other in every way, even in language. Though there exists an
                    official language, Bahasa Indonesia (literally translated to “Language Indonesia”), every region
                    speaks their own language as well. Bahasa is more of a stripped down to the basic language used for
                    communication with the Dutch heirs in the early days.
                    Beside of cultural insights I had finally some time to spend in nature! Bogor, a city located under
                    Depok, hosts a beautiful botanical garden as well as a resident of the Indonesian president. It is
                    filled with various in Latin-labeled plants and trees of which my roommate could have made more
                    sense of than me (as he focusses on Plant Biology). Nevertheless, I could still admire the beauty of
                    it to the fullest.

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">Pulau Seribu (“1000 Islands”) is a chain of actually around 110 islands
                    located north-west of Jakarta. We were staying for three days at Pramuka Island and exploring the
                    surrounding islands from there including the National Marine Park, a sanctuary for Hawksbill Sea
                    Turtles and local sharks. You can find the location of our stay in the attached Google Map. (I can
                    only use the Google API cost-free in developer mode, sorry for the inconvenience)
                    The locals’ life a lay-back life fishing, dancing, and singing all day and do not worry too much
                    about the hectic life of their fellow citizens in Jakarta. We had a chance to calm down and were
                    indulging paradise for a little bit. I saw some kids fighting like in a series I watched as a kid
                    called “Naruto”. Somehow that made me cringe but also nostalgic at the same time.

                    Processing hold by Prof. Aniati a very slow-paced, old women which was involved in several research
                    topics including Change Recognition for landscapes, Sleep Analysis, and Cancer Detection. Really
                    interesting stuff, even though she was not able to go deeper into the topics. Nevertheless,
                    she
                    still managed to end her lecture in 45 minutes. Even the lecturers are laidback here. As it turns
                    out,
                    Bioinformatics is not available this semester which is why I switched to Advanced Machine Learning
                    instead. The master students have a dedicated room for studying, likewise the bachelor and degree
                    students. Luckily, I was able to make some new friends. I was really glad as I am the only exchange
                    student in computer science this semester. I was just sitting down for a few hours and already had a
                    few
                    helping hands for my upcoming Bahasa Indonesia class or any other obstacles as well as a few new
                    numbers
                    to call. (The image shows the logo of UI, way cooler than the TU Darmstadt if you ask me)

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The last weeks were rather unspectacular, at least in a
                    non-computer-science related perspective. I am currently working on the cover of an album I want to
                    produce during my stay here. I have simply applied a gaussian-high-pass filter with some fine tweaks
                    to a blurred image of mine. It turned out to get the kind of strange look that I wanted to achieve.
                    I was aiming for
                    highlighting the edges of the image as done when extracting most interesting features, like in
                    general classification and object recognition tasks. You can find the code snippet below.

                        def plot(data, title):
                            plot.i += 1

                <h2>Riot</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The Indonesian people have voted and the government has spoken - by
                    revising the criminal code and planing to legislate absolutely hilarious laws that I must post in
                    this blog. My top three: Publicly criticising the president (3 years jail), Rape victims go to
                    prison if they abort
                    the baby (4 years jail) and the best one, if you have a chicken in your house and the chicken
                    trespasses onto your neighbours' lawn, you'll be jailed as well - absolutely ridiculous.
                    Of course, I have double checked the resources and as it turns out it was from some kind of twitter
                    account of which I did not find any further origins. Nevertheless, my buddies (like every local
                    Indonesian student I have met) say these proposed laws are really serious, which would explain why
                    the riots in Jakarta last weekend were escalating completely. Allegedly, two students from another
                    university even died. Of course, I cannot say these are facts but rather hearsay. We exchange
                    students were repeatedly asked, even begged to not go to Jakarta at all for the whole week, even
                    officially by the International Office of UI. One should also mention, that we foreigners do not
                    have the right to protest here and will be deported immediately if arrested even near protest
                    grounds. What a wonderful, free country I am living in. I do not really know how I should think
                    about this. Obviously, I did not listen to the warnings and went two days after the riots to the
                    national orchestra in Jakarta, as I did not want to miss it a second time. (The first time was
                    because I sliced my foot up on a coral) Nothing happened though, plus I was not even near any former
                    protest ground, which is why I found it way to ridiculous to not go. Though I would really like to
                    go to the protests, a friend of mine made not a good but a fair point by saying that the
                    "Indonesian people must fight their own battles, and know their own situation the best". Although, I
                    will stay undercover (which is anyway necessary as I have way to much to do right now), this
                    does not really satisfy me. - Let me conclude with the following lines from Les Miserables - Do you
                    hear the people sing?
                    Singing the songs of angry men?
                    It is the music of the people
                    Who will not be slaves again!
                    When the beating of your heart
                    Echoes the beating of the drums
                    There is a life about to start
                    When tomorrow comes!

                <h2>Escape from Depok</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium"> We were visiting Yogyakarta over the weekend to see the cultural area
                    of Indonesia and catch a fresh breather, like literally, the air was amazing. We took a 8h train
                    ride across East to Central/West Java and spend two days in Yogya (as the locals call it) visiting
                    several temples, including Borobudur and Prambanan, two giant buddhist and hinduistic temples and
                    checking out the amazing food. We were staying at the Los Manos Hostel which I can highly recommend
                    to anyone who goes there. The check-in guy we met there was also kind enough to drive us around the
                    city, as the taxi company did not have enough drivers at the moment. If you are there by chance ask
                    for Andy! On
                    the last night before my departure I met a guy from Poland and chatted a little with him. His family
                    lives near the hometown of my grandparents. After I was casually small-talking about my computer
                    science studies he was asking me, if I know the Honey Badger project. Allegedly, he was working for
                    a company collaborating with Facebook about 10 years ago as a, let us say, "human filter". He had to filter out all inappropriate
                    content which was not recognized by the filters at that time and told us some really horrible
                    stuff, though he gladly did not go into any details. Crazy dude, crazy stories, still I do not know if I can believe him, it is just too much
                    of a coincidence.
