                <h2>Arrival</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The flight was long, really long, 24 hours from Frankfurt to Jakarta
                    with an eight hour stop in Doha.
                    I had a lot of time checking out the airport which was easily explorable through a futuristic,
                    mostly glass-made railway driving above the heads
                    of mere citizens which were eager to find their gates by foot. After arriving in Jakarta and passing
                    the border control I was greeted by students
                    of the Universitas Indonesia (UI) dressed in bright, yellow suit jackets (looking as bad as it
                    sounds).
                    Hasbi was one of them which accompanied me and William, another student from Darmstadt, to our
                    apartments at the Margonda Residence in Depok.
                    As we were on the road around 5pm we were not the only ones trying to get their way to Jakarta. The
                    traffic was unbelievable
                    and scooter drivers insane in their confidence to maneuver through this see of vehicles. It was
                    intense but we made it out alive as it seems to be
                    a general practice of Indonesians to drive in such circumstances. My buddy Desti welcomed me at the
                    residence and showed me my apartment
                    in the allegedly 16th floor of the building. (The elevator misses out floor 14 and 15 as they’re not
                    selectable) Afterwards,
                    I could catch a good night of sleep, even though an Islamic priest woke me up at 4 in the morning.
                    It was a good day.</p> <!-- Section Content -->

                <h2>Orientation</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">It is crazy how living in a completely different country can become
                    simple routine in just a week. The crowded shattering of a docent vehicles fades to white noise
                    while I manage to find my way through Depok (city on the southern border of Jakarta) by myself. My
                    co-students and I underwent several events in the last days, including orientation days to get to
                    know the campus and the library (which is apparently the biggest in south-east Asia), as well as
                    team building events to get to know each other. Surprisingly, everyone seems to get along
                    independent of cultural, religious, or national differences. The Indonesian people are so proactive
                    and helpful that anxieties of any kind are never present. Another student was capturing this feeling
                    very good by saying that: “I am so cherished and cared for that I do not feel as I have left home.”
                    One of the events was the Orientation Day in which we were introduced into some organizational
                    topics as well as cultural aspects of Indonesia, including a local dance performed bare foot with a
                    plate in each hand. Those plates were circularly moved while dancing and sometimes even moved on
                    without breaking. I have never seen something that exotic before.
                    In the last days I had also enough time to organize my apartment, buy a second hand guitar in
                    Jakarta and spend a whole day in Jakarta’s tourist districts. As it seems, we tourists are part of
                    the attractions as well, especially the Caucasian looking exchange students, as several inhabitants
                    asked them frequently to take pictures with them. Even I was asked twice!
                    Today I had the chance to meet Dr. Ade Azurat a member of the faculty of computer science at UI who
                    gave me a tour through the campus and even introduced me to everyone I might contact in the future,
                    including the head of Master students, secretariat, and faculty speaker. He is a very nice guy with
                    a great taste of humor. I am planning to take a Bioinformatics and Advanced Computer Vision class.
                    As I am working as a freelancer for Fraunhofer I will probably not find the time to take more
                    courses. (Besides seeing the country of course)

                <h2>Culture & Nature</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The area around Jakarta is filled with various mysterious places and
                    stores in which you can easily loose yourself. One of them was a miniature park representing
                    different areas of Indonesia, including Bali, Sumatra, and Borneo. The UI Buddy Club organized a
                    tour for us in which we were introduced to the cultural differences between the different parts of
                    Indonesia. Those differences were shown in examples of ceremonial dresses, tools & weaponry, as well
                    as construction and art. Even though the regions uniformed as one country they are still remarkably
                    unique and differentiable from each other in every way, even in language. Though there exists an
                    official language, Bahasa Indonesia (literally translated to “Language Indonesia”), every region
                    speaks their own language as well. Bahasa is more of a stripped down to the basic language used for
                    communication with the Dutch heirs in the early days.
                    Beside of cultural insights I had finally some time to spend in nature! Bogor, a city located under
                    Depok, hosts a beautiful botanical garden as well as a resident of the Indonesian president. It is
                    filled with various in Latin-labeled plants and trees of which my roommate could have made more
                    sense of than me (as he focusses on Plant Biology). Nevertheless, I could still admire the beauty of
                    it to the fullest.

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">Pulau Seribu (“1000 Islands”) is a chain of actually around 110 islands
                    located north-west of Jakarta. We were staying for three days at Pramuka Island and exploring the
                    surrounding islands from there including the National Marine Park, a sanctuary for Hawksbill Sea
                    Turtles and local sharks. You can find the location of our stay in the attached Google Map. (I can
                    only use the Google API cost-free in developer mode, sorry for the inconvenience)
                    The locals’ life a lay-back life fishing, dancing, and singing all day and do not worry too much
                    about the hectic life of their fellow citizens in Jakarta. We had a chance to calm down and were
                    indulging paradise for a little bit. I saw some kids fighting like in a series I watched as a kid
                    called “Naruto”. Somehow that made me cringe but also nostalgic at the same time.

                    Processing hold by Prof. Aniati a very slow-paced, old women which was involved in several research
                    topics including Change Recognition for landscapes, Sleep Analysis, and Cancer Detection. Really
                    interesting stuff, even though she was not able to go deeper into the topics. Nevertheless,
                    she
                    still managed to end her lecture in 45 minutes. Even the lecturers are laidback here. As it turns
                    out,
                    Bioinformatics is not available this semester which is why I switched to Advanced Machine Learning
                    instead. The master students have a dedicated room for studying, likewise the bachelor and degree
                    students. Luckily, I was able to make some new friends. I was really glad as I am the only exchange
                    student in computer science this semester. I was just sitting down for a few hours and already had a
                    few
                    helping hands for my upcoming Bahasa Indonesia class or any other obstacles as well as a few new
                    numbers
                    to call. (The image shows the logo of UI, way cooler than the TU Darmstadt if you ask me)

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The last weeks were rather unspectacular, at least in a
                    non-computer-science related perspective. I am currently working on the cover of an album I want to
                    produce during my stay here. I have simply applied a gaussian-high-pass filter with some fine tweaks
                    to a blurred image of mine. It turned out to get the kind of strange look that I wanted to achieve.
                    I was aiming for
                    highlighting the edges of the image as done when extracting interest points, like in
                    general classification and object recognition tasks. You can find the code snippet below. UPDATE: The Album is finished! You can find it

                <h2>Riot</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The Indonesian people have voted and the government has spoken - by
                    revising the criminal code and planing to legislate absolutely hilarious laws that I must post in
                    this blog. My top three: Publicly criticising the president (3 years jail), Rape victims go to
                    prison if they abort
                    the baby (4 years jail) and the best one, if you have a chicken in your house and the chicken
                    trespasses onto your neighbours' lawn, you'll be jailed as well - absolutely ridiculous.
                    Of course, I have double checked the resources and as it turns out it was from some kind of twitter
                    account of which I did not find any further origins. Nevertheless, my buddies (like every local
                    Indonesian student I have met) say these proposed laws are really serious, which would explain why
                    the riots in Jakarta last weekend were escalating completely. Allegedly, two students from another
                    university even died. Of course, I cannot say these are facts but rather hearsay. We exchange
                    students were repeatedly asked, even begged not to go to Jakarta at all for the whole week, even
                    officially by the International Office of UI. One should also mention, that we foreigners do not
                    have the right to protest here and will be deported immediately if arrested even near protest
                    grounds. What a wonderful, free country I am living in. I do not really know how I should think
                    about this. Two days after the riots I went to the
                    national orchestra in Jakarta, as I did not want to miss it a second time. (The first time was
                    because I sliced my foot up on a coral). Though I would really like to
                    go to the protests, a friend of mine made not a good but a fair point by saying that the
                    "Indonesian people must fight their own battles, and know their own situation the best". Although, I
                    will stay undercover (which is anyway necessary as I have way to much to do right now), this
                    does not really satisfy me. - Let me conclude with the following lines from Les Miserables - Do you
                    hear the people sing?
                    Singing the songs of angry men?
                    It is the music of the people
                    Who will not be slaves again!
                    When the beating of your heart
                    Echoes the beating of the drums
                    There is a life about to start
                    When tomorrow comes!

                <h2>Escape from Depok</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium"> We were visiting Yogyakarta over the weekend to see the cultural area
                    of Indonesia and catch a fresh breather, like literally, the air was amazing. We took a 8h train
                    ride across East to West Java and spend two days in Yogya (as the locals call it) visiting
                    several temples, including Borobudur and Prambanan, two giant buddhist and hinduistic temples and
                    checking out the amazing food. We were staying at the Los Manos Hostel which I can highly recommend
                    to anyone who goes there. The check-in guy we met was also kind enough to drive us around the
                    city, as the taxi company did not have enough drivers at the moment. If you are there, ask
                    for Andy! On
                    the last night before my departure I met a guy from Poland and chatted a little with him. His family
                    lives near the hometown of my grandparents. After I was casually small-talking about my computer
                    science studies he was asking me, if I know the Honey Badger project. Allegedly, he was working for
                    a company collaborating with Facebook about 10 years ago as a, let us say, "human filter". He had to
                    filter out all inappropriate
                    content which was not recognized by the filters at that time and told us some really horrible
                    stuff, though he gladly did not go into any details. Crazy dude, crazy stories, still I do not know
                    if I can believe him, it is just too much
                    of a coincidence.

                    <xxx>My Machine Learning professor is somehow very good at communicating different content to
                        different people. Two weeks prior I was working 24/7 on several assignments, including a
                        paper review about Adversarial Examples against Deep Neural Networks. It was a very interesting
                        topic as it somehow strapped the power of the big Machine Learning hype we have
                        experienced in the
                        last years. Especially, the One-Pixel Attack against Convolutional Neural
                        Networks was very surprising as it managed to falsify image classification by only altering
                        one
                        pixel. I finished my review before the 1st October as I thought we had to do. I also asked some
                        other classmates just to be sure but only got more confused. As it turned out, we only had to do
                        a
                        research proposal and had time to finish the review until December. Of course, my professor was
                        quite surprised when I told him that I am already finished. Well, less work for me in the coming
                        days. Because of that I could use the last two weekends to visit some places in Java, like
                        Yogyakarta or Ujung Kulon last weekend. The sub-island Ujung Kulon is maybe one of the most
                        untouched peaces of nature I have ever seen. I could not find any piece of trash at all and the
                        beaches looked like directly taken out of an advertisement. Wild animals, like makak monkeys,
                        pigs,
                        and deers were just walking around the beaches. The cheeky monkeys were always on a stroll to
                        steal our stuff, mostly without success but always eager to try again. The national park is also
                        a harbour for the last
                        remaining 60 Javanese Rhinos. Except of a sunburn and not enough sleep it was a wonderful
                        experience.

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">
                    <xxx>Nico Kettler (Kiedla), my good friend from Germany visited me over the last week. Truth be told, it
                        was a
                        big relief for mee to see someone from my old circle again. When you spend so much time abroad away from
                        family and friends you grow custom to the character shifts and changes you subconsciously make.
                        Although, you know deep inside that the people you have met in the last months can not, and will not understand you as good as the ones you have known
                        for
                        years. I have introduced him to my daily life in Depok, showed him my university, some buddies,
                        and a lot of traditional food. Gladly, his stomach was prepared for this culinary expedition. We
                        spend a whole day in Jakarta visiting the harbour, fish market, old town, chinatown, Belanda
                        Bridge, and city central. We met an old man at the harbour which gave us a insightful tour to
                        all
                        places we wanted to visit, also enabling us to enter some mahogany transport ships which were
                        setting for Sumatra. It was an amazing opportunity. Besides, he organized a ride in a
                        classical vehicle, a three-wheeled car called Pajai, in which he guided us through Jakarta to
                        our destinations. We spend the night getting totally lost in the rush hour but escaped after
                        four hours (keep in mind, that Depok is only about 40km away from central Jakarta).
                        Besides visiting the Botanical Garden in Bogor, I finally had the chance to go hiking on Mt.
                        Salak.
                        Kiedla, a buddy from my university, and I spend two days and one night on the mysterious
                        volcano. It
                        was engulfed in a mystical fog which rendered it impossible to see how long the way was. Due to
                        heavy rain before our arrival at the foot of the mountain the way was very difficult to pass.
                        Slippery mud made it impossible to walk in a fast pace. Nevertheless, we made it safely to the
                        camping place. Although we wanted to reach the mountain top as well, we decided not to, as it
                        would have been way to dangerous. Coming sunrise we made our way to the viewpoint which was easier
                        accessible from the camping place. Also, the way was easier to walk on on the second day. The
                        vista point was unbelievable. Sulfur smog emerged out of several craters and ascended
                        into the sunny sky. The smell was disgusting but the view tremendous.

                <h2>Lombok</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">
                    <xxx>Right after Kiedla went back home another friend from high school visited me, Noah Siegler. He
                        had only one goal, which was learning to surf, so I asked a few locals which places they could
                        recommend us.
                        Obviously, Bali was a very prominent place, though I did not want to go somewhere too touristic
                        which is why we went to Lombok, the neighboring island of Bali. The first thing
                        we realised was that a ridiculous amount of Germans were staying there during our visit. We
                        met several people from Munich, including our hotel hostess, as well as one girl which even
                        lives near our hometowns, coming from Mannheim (let us call her Eve). It was easy to find
                        someone who can teach us to
                        surf, we called him
                        "Chef" as we could not remember his name. Also, he was always behaving like a real Chef, always
                        lecturing us about how to read the waves and other typical surfer-guy-stuff. Speaking of
                        stereotypes, I must say that all of the surfer guys we talked to met the description. Though
                        they were
                        hilarious, they were mostly running around after girls and rarely lost themselves
                        in too complicated topics which made conversations with them rarely interesting but often hilarious.
                        We did not only socialize with a lot of
                        local surfers on the beaches but had also the unbelievable opportunity to see a real fisher
                        village and a traditional wedding, but let me get back a few steps for this story.

                        When we met Eve, we also met two guys from Austria, who were telling us this crazy story about a
                        bar called "Small but Spicy" near the main crossroad in Kuta. They asked us to meet them there
                        one evening which we of course did. Arriving there, it turned out that the bar consisted of a
                        few plastic chairs, a surfboard which was transfunctionalized to a table and a small bar waggon. We
                        could not believe it but still decided to stay there for a while. After half a hour, when our
                        faith was at the lowest, the others finally arrived - half a hour later the whole place was cramped!
                        That was when we met O'Reilly, on of the big guys, also called "Legend" by the locals, who is
                        responsible for managing the real-estate in this area of Kuta. After shortly talking to us he suddenly
                        rushed of to some guy coming by on a scooter, came back, and asked us swiftly if we wanted to
                        attend the wedding of his cousin tomorrow. After some healthy contemplation and suspicion we accepted. The next day he
                        guided us to a place in which we got traditional clothing for the wedding, including a Sarung, a
                        fancy stitched cloth comparable to a colorful kilt, a dagger, and a bandana. Afterwards, we spend noon exploring his village,
                        and headed out to the place of the parade. In traditional Balinese, and Lombokian fashion, the
                        bride and groom marched in a big parade to the village of the bride's parents. We lost ourselves
                        easily in middle of hundreds of dancing and singing locals. It was a moment you cannot buy for
                        money, pure luck, the right place at the right time.

                <p class="color-contrast-medium">
                    <xxx>In context of my course "Advanced Image Processing" I have worked on new techniques of using
                        satellite images to detect hotspots of deforestation. I have used Landsat 8 data, a
                        very prominent source of satellite imagery, ranging back to 2013 to observe the region of
                        Islamabad in Pakistan. I chose this region as it is an area which suffered under tremendous
                        deforestation over the last 20 years, which is shown in my work as well. One can consider the
                        work
                        of Rehman et al. for further insights or my paper (please keep in mind that this is not a
                        version prepared for <a
                                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13a0y8vEHaQuo1snAmVkav01--WffLYxF/view?usp=sharing"
                                target="_blank">publication</a>.
                        The image below shows my results and by that confirms what Rehman et al. discovered. The
                        images observe a region of ~180kmx180km in which no green, hence dense forest region, can be
                        detected
                        anymore.

            <p class="color-contrast-medium">
                <xxx>5 Months in Indonesia are over and I am making my way to Kuala Lumpur as one of my destinations in
                    discovering further regions of south-east Asia. I had tremendous opportunities to expend my academic
                    knowledge, as well as cultural experience and I can say that I seized them to the fullest.
                    Although, there are still a variety of places waiting to be discovered, I cannot really say that I
                    regret not doing some particular activity. Well, except of not seeing Komodo Lizards, but I guess I
                    can
                    look over that. I will miss this place, especially the new friends I met, s/o to Echan in Lombok -
                    the most beautiful and relaxing place in Indonesia, my
                    Buddy Desti who was always there to assist me accommodating to this strange no-mans-land called
                    Depok (you should have won the UI Best Buddy nomination by the way), and
                    everyone else who was sharing their time with me. If you're reading this: William, do not
                    loose your temper to often, you got to leaver your german attitude sometimes behind to survive here,
                    keep it up! Hira, stop being so edgy - Still, I have enjoyed every second of our socio-political
                    discussions. Thomas, I hope you keep on having a beautiful time here in the next semester, I will
                    visit you in France someday - As we like to say in german and I know you understand that: "Es
                    ist nur ein Katzensprung entfernt". Dery, I hope you will excel at your new job at PWC and I know
                    Desti will get accepted their as well (hopefully, my strategy with the coffee will work out). If i
                    find my
                    way back to consulting, I will join you in some kind of international project. Everyone else
                    I did not mention can be sure that they will pop up in one of my daydreams eventually.
                    Especially, I would also like to thank Universitas Indonesia, including the International Office,
                    Computer Science staff, and fellow students for supporting and teaching me in their best intend. It
                    was different,
                    sometimes estranging, but certainly always very insightful. Sampai jumpa!
