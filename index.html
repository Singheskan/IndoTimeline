                <h2>Arrival</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">The flight was long, really long, 24 hours from Frankfurt to Jakarta
                    with an eight hour stop in Doha.
                    I had a lot of time checking out the airport which was easily explorable through a futuristic,
                    mostly glass-made railway driving above the heads
                    of mere citizens which were eager to find their gates by foot. After arriving in Jakarta and passing
                    the border control I was greeted by students
                    of the Universitas Indonesia (UI) dressed in bright, yellow suit jackets (looking as bad as it
                    sounds).
                    Hasbi was one of them which accompanied me and William, another student from Darmstadt, to our
                    apartments at the Margonda Residence in Depok.
                    As we were on the road around 5pm we were not the only ones trying to get their way to Jakarta. The
                    traffic was unbelievable
                    and scooter drivers insane in their confidence to maneuver through this see of vehicles. It was
                    intense but we made it out alive as it seems to be
                    a general practice of Indonesians to drive in such circumstances. My buddy Desti welcomed me at the
                    residence and showed me my apartment
                    in the allegedly 16th floor of the building. (The elevator misses out floor 14 and 15 as they’re not
                    selectable) Afterwards,
                    I could catch a good night of sleep, even though an Islamic priest woke me up at 4 in the morning.
                    It was a good day.</p> <!-- Section Content -->

                <h2>Orientation</h2> <!-- Section Title -->
                <p class="color-contrast-medium">It is crazy how living in a completely different country can become
                    simple routine in just a week. The crowded shattering of a docent vehicles fades to white noise
                    while I manage to find my way through Depok (city on the southern border of Jakarta) by myself. My
                    co-students and I underwent several events in the last days, including orientation days to get to
                    know the campus and the library (which is apparently the biggest in south-east Asia), as well as
                    team building events to get to know each other. Surprisingly, everyone seems to get along
                    independent of cultural, religious, or national differences. The Indonesian people are so proactive
                    and helpful that anxieties of any kind are never present. Another student was capturing this feeling
                    very good by saying that: “I am so cherished and cared for that I do not feel as I have left home.”
                    One of the events was the Orientation Day in which we were introduced into some organizational
                    topics as well as cultural aspects of Indonesia, including a local dance performed bare foot with a
                    plate in each hand. Those plates were circularly moved while dancing and sometimes even moved on
                    without breaking. I have never seen something that exotic before.
                    In the last days I had also enough time to organize my apartment, buy a second hand guitar in
                    Jakarta and spend a whole day in Jakarta’s tourist districts. As it seems, we tourists are part of
                    the attractions as well, especially the Caucasian looking exchange students, as several inhabitants
                    asked them frequently to take pictures with them. Even I was asked twice!
                    Today I had the chance to meet Dr. Ade Azurat a member of the faculty of computer science at UI who
                    gave me a tour through the campus and even introduced me to everyone I might contact in the future,
                    including the head of Master students, secretariat, and faculty speaker. He is a very nice guy with
                    a great taste of humor. I am planning to take a Bioinformatics and Advanced Computer Vision class.
                    As I am working as a freelancer for Fraunhofer I will probably not find the time to take more
                    courses. (Besides seeing the country of course)
